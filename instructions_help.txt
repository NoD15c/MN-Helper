Make a new folder on your desktop ( any name )
Put the files frome the MN-Helper folder  in it. (Current MN-Helper-Setup.ps1, MN-ErrorReport.ps1, MN-Reporter.ps1, MN-Scheduler.ps1, MN-Alert.ps1)
Open your powershell and navigate to this new folder and start the MN-Helper-Setup.ps1 file
This Setup will save a ini.txt file and mailpw.txt and maybee a backupfile of them if you choise it, in the folder. This files are needed fort the other .ps1 scripts.
 They load the variables over it.The ini and pw file will needed to hold the settings on a restart oft he scripts.
In the first steps on mail account setting it needs to create a credential Username/pw from the Mailaccount. 
It will be save as a Securestring and will work only on the same Computer you created it.
In my example i use gmx - works great - but you have to activate IMAP in the settings of your GMX account - needs some minutes to work after switching
